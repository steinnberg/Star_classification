# Star_classification
  In astronomy, stellar classification is the classification of stars based on their spectral characteristics. In thoses spectres, spectral lines Each line indicates a particular chemical element or molecule. The strengths of the different spectral lines vary mainly due to the temperature of the photosphere. 
  Most stars are currently classified under the Morganâ€“Keenan (MK) system using the letters O, B, A, F, G, K, and M, a sequence from the hottest (O type) to the coolest (M type). Each letter class is then subdivided using a numeric digit with 0 being hottest and 9 being coolest (e.g., A8, A9, F0, and F1 form a sequence from hotter to cooler).
